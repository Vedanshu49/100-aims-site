### Aim #36: Perform intersection of two sets of students.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to find the **intersection** of two sets. The intersection is a new set containing only the elements that are present in *both* original sets.

**Python Code**

```python
# Students in Class A
class_a = {"Aarav", "Diya", "Vivaan", "Riya"}

# Students in Class B
class_b = {"Riya", "Kabir", "Diya", "Ishaan"}

print(f"Class A: {class_a}")
print(f"Class B: {class_b}")

# Method 1: Using the & (intersection) operator
common_students_op = class_a & class_b
print(f"\nIntersection using operator '&': {common_students_op}")

# Method 2: Using the .intersection() method
common_students_method = class_a.intersection(class_b)
print(f"Intersection using '.intersection()' method: {common_students_method}")
```

**Output**

```text
Class A: {'Riya', 'Diya', 'Vivaan', 'Aarav'}
Class B: {'Riya', 'Diya', 'Kabir', 'Ishaan'}

Intersection using operator '&': {'Riya', 'Diya'}
Intersection using '.intersection()' method: {'Riya', 'Diya'}
```

**Explanation**

- **Set Intersection**: An intersection finds the common ground between two sets. The resulting set includes only those elements that exist in `class_a` AND `class_b`.
- **Intersection Operator `&`**: The ampersand `&` operator is a concise way to find the intersection of two sets.
- **`.intersection()` Method**: The `set1.intersection(set2)` method performs the exact same operation. It can be more readable, especially to those less familiar with the operator syntax. Both approaches create a new set and leave the original sets unchanged.
