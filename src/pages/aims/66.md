### Aim #66: Perform dot product of two arrays.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to calculate the dot product of two NumPy arrays. The dot product is a fundamental operation in linear algebra.

**Python Code**

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(f"Array 1: {array1}")
print(f"Array 2: {array2}")

# Calculate the dot product using np.dot()
dot_product = np.dot(array1, array2)

print(f"\nDot product of the two arrays: {dot_product}")
```

**Output**

```text
Array 1: [1 2 3]
Array 2: [4 5 6]

Dot product of the two arrays: 32
```

**Explanation**

- **Dot Product**: For two 1D arrays (vectors), the dot product is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements.
- **Calculation**: In this case, the calculation is `(1*4) + (2*5) + (3*6) = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32`.
- **`np.dot()` Function**: The `np.dot(a, b)` function is the standard way to compute the dot product in NumPy. It can also perform matrix multiplication for 2D arrays, making it a very versatile function.
