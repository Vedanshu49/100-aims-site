### Aim #9: Slice a list to get the first five elements.

**Description**

This program demonstrates *slicing*, a powerful feature for accessing parts of a list. We will extract a "slice" of our list that contains only the first five names.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list of 10 student names
student_names = [
    "Aarav", "Vivaan", "Aditya", "Diya", "Saanvi",
    "Ananya", "Ishaan", "Riya", "Kabir", "Myra"
]

print(f"Original list: {student_names}")

# Slice the list to get elements from the beginning up to index 5 (exclusive)
first_five = student_names[0:5]

# A simpler way to write the same slice
# first_five = student_names[:5]

print(f"\nFirst five elements: {first_five}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original list: ['Aarav', 'Vivaan', 'Aditya', 'Diya', 'Saanvi', 'Ananya', 'Ishaan', 'Riya', 'Kabir', 'Myra']

First five elements: ['Aarav', 'Vivaan', 'Aditya', 'Diya', 'Saanvi']
```

**Explanation**

- **Slicing Syntax**: Slicing is done using square brackets with a colon, like `list[start:end]`.
- **`start` (Inclusive)**: The `start` index is the first element to be included in the slice. Here, it's `0`. If omitted, it defaults to the beginning of the list.
- **`end` (Exclusive)**: The `end` index is the first element *not* to be included. So, `[0:5]` includes elements at indices 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, but stops *before* index 5.
- **Shorthand**: `student_names[:5]` is a common shorthand for `student_names[0:5]`. It means "give me all elements from the beginning up to (but not including) index 5."
