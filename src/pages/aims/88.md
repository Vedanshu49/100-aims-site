### Aim #88: Save a plot as an image file.

**Description**

This program reinforces a critical step for using Matplotlib in web projects or reports: saving the generated plot to an image file (like PNG or JPG) using `plt.savefig()`.

**Python Code**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [1, 4, 9, 16]

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("A Simple Plot")

# Define the output file path
output_file = "public/aim88_saved_plot.png"

# Use plt.savefig() to save the current figure to a file
# This should be done before plt.show() if you were using it.
try:
    plt.savefig(output_file)
    print(f"Plot successfully saved to '{output_file}'")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred while saving the plot: {e}")

```

**Output**

```text
Plot successfully saved to 'public/aim88_saved_plot.png'
```

![Saved Plot](/aim88_saved_plot.png)

**Explanation**

- **`plt.savefig(filepath)`**: This function saves the current Matplotlib figure to the specified file path.
- **File Format**: Matplotlib automatically determines the file format based on the extension you provide in the filepath (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.svg`).
- **Order Matters**: It's important to call `plt.savefig()` *before* you would call `plt.show()`. In many environments, `plt.show()` clears the figure after it's displayed, so calling `savefig()` after `show()` might result in a blank image.
