### Aim #37: Check if one set is a subset of another.

**Description**

This program explains how to determine if all elements of one set are contained within another set, a concept known as a **subset**.

**Python Code**

```python
all_students = {"Aarav", "Diya", "Vivaan", "Riya", "Kabir"}
drama_club = {"Diya", "Riya", "Kabir"}
math_club = {"Aarav", "Ishaan"}

print(f"All Students: {all_students}")
print(f"Drama Club: {drama_club}")
print(f"Math Club: {math_club}")

# Check if drama_club is a subset of all_students
is_subset_1 = drama_club.issubset(all_students)
print(f"\nIs the Drama Club a subset of All Students? {is_subset_1}")

# Check if math_club is a subset of all_students
is_subset_2 = math_club.issubset(all_students)
print(f"Is the Math Club a subset of All Students? {is_subset_2}")
```

**Output**

```text
All Students: {'Riya', 'Diya', 'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Kabir'}
Drama Club: {'Riya', 'Diya', 'Kabir'}
Math Club: {'Aarav', 'Ishaan'}

Is the Drama Club a subset of All Students? True
Is the Math Club a subset of All Students? False
```

**Explanation**

- **Subset**: A set `A` is a subset of set `B` if every element in `A` is also present in `B`.
- **`.issubset()` Method**: The `set1.issubset(set2)` method checks if `set1` is a subset of `set2`. It returns a boolean value: `True` if all elements of `set1` are in `set2`, and `False` otherwise.
- **Results**:
    - `drama_club` is a subset of `all_students` because "Diya", "Riya", and "Kabir" are all in the `all_students` set.
    - `math_club` is not a subset because one of its members, "Ishaan", is not in the `all_students` set.
