### Aim #12: Create a tuple of 5 subjects and print it.

**Description**

This program introduces the **tuple**, another collection data type in Python. We will create a tuple containing five subject names and print it to the console.

**Python Code**

```python
# A tuple is created using parentheses ()
# Tuples are ordered and unchangeable (immutable)
subjects_tuple = (
    "Mathematics",
    "Physics",
    "Chemistry",
    "Biology",
    "English"
)

print("The tuple of subjects is:")
print(subjects_tuple)
print(f"\nThe type of the data structure is: {type(subjects_tuple)}")
```

**Output**

```text
The tuple of subjects is:
('Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'English')

The type of the data structure is: <class 'tuple'>
```

**Explanation**

- **Tuple Creation**: Tuples are created by placing items inside parentheses `()`, separated by commas.
- **Key Difference from Lists**: The most important characteristic of a tuple is that it is **immutable**. This means once a tuple is created, you cannot change, add, or remove items. Lists, on the other hand, are mutable.
- **Ordered**: Like lists, tuples are ordered, meaning the items have a defined sequence that will not change.
