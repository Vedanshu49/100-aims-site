### Aim #6: Find the index of a particular element in a list.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to find the position, or *index*, of a specific item in a list. We will use the `index()` method to locate the position of "Aditya Kumar" in our list.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list of student names
student_names = [
    "Aarav Sharma",
    "Vivaan Singh",
    "Aditya Kumar",
    "Diya Patel",
    "Saanvi Gupta"
]

print(f"The list of students is: {student_names}")

# The element we want to find
target_name = "Aditya Kumar"

# Use the index() method to find the position of the target_name
# Python lists are "zero-indexed", meaning the first element is at index 0.
try:
    index_position = student_names.index(target_name)
    print(f"\nThe student '{target_name}' was found at index: {index_position}")
except ValueError:
    print(f"\nThe student '{target_name}' was not found in the list.")
```

**Output**

```text
The list of students is: ['Aarav Sharma', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Aditya Kumar', 'Diya Patel', 'Saanvi Gupta']

The student 'Aditya Kumar' was found at index: 2
```

**Explanation**

- **Zero-Indexing**: It's crucial to remember that Python lists are **zero-indexed**. This means the first element is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.
- **The `index()` Method**: The line `student_names.index(target_name)` searches the list for the first occurrence of the value stored in `target_name` ("Aditya Kumar").
- **Return Value**: If the item is found, the `index()` method returns its index. In this case, "Aditya Kumar" is the third element, so its index is `2`.
- **Error Handling**: If the `index()` method is called with a value that is not in the list, it will raise a `ValueError`. We use a **`try...except`** block to gracefully handle this possibility and print a friendly message instead of crashing the program.
