### Aim #16: Find the length of a tuple.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to find the total number of elements in a tuple using Python's built-in `len()` function.

**Python Code**

```python
# A tuple of subjects
subjects_tuple = (
    "Mathematics",
    "Physics",
    "Chemistry",
    "Biology",
    "English"
)

print(f"The tuple is: {subjects_tuple}")

# Use the len() function to get the number of elements
tuple_length = len(subjects_tuple)

print(f"\nThe length of the tuple is: {tuple_length}")
```

**Output**

```text
The tuple is: ('Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'English')

The length of the tuple is: 5
```

**Explanation**

- **The `len()` Function**: `len()` is a universal built-in function in Python that works on any sequence or collection type (including lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries).
- **How it Works**: It simply counts the number of top-level items within the object it's called on and returns that count as an integer. In this case, it counts the five string elements in our `subjects_tuple`.
