### Aim #32: Create a set of student names to eliminate duplicates.

**Description**

This program introduces the **set**, a data structure that is unordered and only contains unique elements. We will demonstrate how creating a set from a list automatically removes any duplicate values.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list with duplicate names
student_list = [
    "Aarav", "Diya", "Vivaan", "Aarav", "Riya", "Diya"
]

print(f"Original list with duplicates: {student_list}")

# Create a set from the list using the set() constructor
# Duplicates are automatically removed.
student_set = set(student_list)

print(f"\nSet created from the list: {student_set}")
print(f"Type of the new data structure: {type(student_set)}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original list with duplicates: ['Aarav', 'Diya', 'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Riya', 'Diya']

Set created from the list: {'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Riya', 'Diya'}
Type of the new data structure: <class 'set'>
```

**Explanation**

- **Set Properties**: Sets are collections that have two main properties: they are **unordered** (the items have no defined sequence) and they **do not allow duplicate values**.
- **The `set()` Constructor**: When you pass an iterable (like a list) to the `set()` constructor, it iterates through the items and adds them to a new set. If it encounters an item that is already in the set, it simply ignores it.
- **Unordered Output**: Notice that the order of elements in the final set may not match the order from the original list. This is because sets do not maintain insertion order.
