### Aim #98: Create a dictionary from two lists using zip().

**Description**

This program demonstrates a very common and Pythonic way to create a dictionary by combining two lists (one for keys, one for values) using the `zip()` and `dict()` functions.

**Python Code**

```python
students = ['Aarav', 'Diya', 'Vivaan']
marks = [95, 88, 92]

print(f"Keys list (students): {students}")
print(f"Values list (marks): {marks}")

# The zip() function pairs up elements from both lists.
# The dict() constructor then turns these pairs into a dictionary.
student_marks_dict = dict(zip(students, marks))

print(f"\nCreated dictionary: {student_marks_dict}")
```

**Output**

```text
Keys list (students): ['Aarav', 'Diya', 'Vivaan']
Values list (marks): [95, 88, 92]

Created dictionary: {'Aarav': 95, 'Diya': 88, 'Vivaan': 92}
```

**Explanation**

- **`zip(keys, values)`**: The `zip()` function takes two or more iterables and aggregates them. It returns an iterator that produces tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the input iterables. For our lists, `zip(students, marks)` produces `('Aarav', 95)`, then `('Diya', 88)`, then `('Vivaan', 92)`.
- **`dict(zipped_pairs)`**: The `dict()` constructor is able to take a sequence of key-value pairs (like the one `zip` produces) and turn them directly into a dictionary. This one-liner is a highly efficient and readable way to achieve this common task.
