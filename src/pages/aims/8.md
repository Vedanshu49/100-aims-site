### Aim #8: Merge two lists into a single list.

**Description**

This program shows how to combine two separate lists into one. We can achieve this easily using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists.

**Python Code**

```python
# Two separate lists of names
list_one = ["Aarav", "Vivaan", "Aditya"]
list_two = ["Diya", "Saanvi", "Ananya"]

print(f"List one: {list_one}")
print(f"List two: {list_two}")

# Merge the lists using the + operator
merged_list = list_one + list_two

print(f"\nMerged list: {merged_list}")
```

**Output**

```text
List one: ['Aarav', 'Vivaan', 'Aditya']
List two: ['Diya', 'Saanvi', 'Ananya']

Merged list: ['Aarav', 'Vivaan', 'Aditya', 'Diya', 'Saanvi', 'Ananya']
```

**Explanation**

- **List Concatenation**: In Python, the `+` operator can be used to concatenate lists. This operation creates a **new list** containing all the elements from the first list, followed by all the elements from the second list.
- **Original Lists Unchanged**: The original lists, `list_one` and `list_two`, are not modified by this operation. The result is stored in the new `merged_list` variable.
