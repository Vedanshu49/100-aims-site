### Aim #68: Extract a subarray using slicing.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to use slicing to extract a smaller part (a subarray) from a larger NumPy array.

**Python Code**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array from 0 to 9
main_array = np.arange(10)
print(f"Main array: {main_array}")

# Extract elements from index 2 up to (but not including) index 7
subarray = main_array[2:7]

print(f"Subarray from index 2 to 7: {subarray}")
```

**Output**

```text
Main array: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
Subarray from index 2 to 7: [2 3 4 5 6]
```

**Explanation**

- **Slicing Syntax**: Slicing NumPy arrays works just like slicing Python lists, using the `[start:end]` syntax.
- **`start` (Inclusive)**: The starting index of the slice.
- **`end` (Exclusive)**: The slice goes up to, but does not include, this index.
- **Views vs. Copies**: An important concept in NumPy is that slicing an array often creates a **view**, not a copy, of the original array. This means if you modify the subarray, the changes will also affect the original main array. This is done for performance reasons.
