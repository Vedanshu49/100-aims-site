### Aim #70: Create a DataFrame from a dictionary.

**Description**

This program introduces **Pandas**, a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, built on top of NumPy. We will create our first **DataFrame**, the primary data structure in Pandas, from a Python dictionary.

**Python Code**

```python
# First, you need to have Pandas installed:
# pip install pandas

import pandas as pd

# A dictionary where keys are column names and values are lists of column data
data = {
    'StudentName': ['Aarav', 'Diya', 'Vivaan', 'Riya'],
    'Marks': [95, 88, 92, 98],
    'Subject': ['Math', 'Science', 'Math', 'English']
}

# Create a DataFrame from the dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

print("The Pandas DataFrame is:")
print(df)
```

**Output**

```text
The Pandas DataFrame is:
  StudentName  Marks  Subject
0       Aarav     95     Math
1        Diya     88  Science
2      Vivaan     92     Math
3        Riya     98  English
```

**Explanation**

- **Importing Pandas**: The standard convention is to `import pandas as pd`.
- **DataFrame**: A DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet, a SQL table, or a dictionary of Series objects.
- **`pd.DataFrame()`**: The `pd.DataFrame()` constructor is the primary way to create a DataFrame. One of the most common ways to create one is from a dictionary of lists, where each key becomes a column header and each list becomes the data for that column.
- **Index**: Notice the numbers `0, 1, 2, 3` on the far left. This is the **index** of the DataFrame, which is used to label and access the rows. Pandas creates a default integer index if one is not specified.
