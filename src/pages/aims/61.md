### Aim #61: Create a 2D NumPy array (3x3 matrix).

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to create a two-dimensional (2D) NumPy array, which can be thought of as a matrix or a table of numbers.

**Python Code**

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D array from a list of lists
# Each inner list represents a row.
list_of_lists = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

matrix = np.array(list_of_lists)

print(f"The 2D NumPy array (matrix) is:\n{matrix}")
print(f"\nThe shape of the array is: {matrix.shape}")
```

**Output**

```text
The 2D NumPy array (matrix) is:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

The shape of the array is: (3, 3)
```

**Explanation**

- **List of Lists**: To create a 2D array, we provide the `np.array()` function with a list of lists. Each inner list forms a row in the resulting 2D array.
- **Shape**: The `.shape` attribute now returns a tuple with two values: `(rows, columns)`. In this case, `(3, 3)` indicates that the array has 3 rows and 3 columns.
- **Matrix**: This structure is fundamental in mathematics and data science and is often referred to as a matrix. NumPy is highly optimized for performing mathematical operations on these matrices.
