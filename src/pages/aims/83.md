### Aim #83: Create a scatter plot of two variables.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to create a scatter plot, which is used to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables.

**Python Code**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

hours_studied = [2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 7]
exam_scores = [65, 70, 85, 60, 90, 78, 92]

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.scatter(hours_studied, exam_scores, color='red')

plt.title('Relationship between Hours Studied and Exam Scores')
plt.xlabel('Hours Studied')
plt.ylabel('Exam Score')
plt.grid(True)

output_path = 'public/aim83_scatter_plot.png'
plt.savefig(output_path)

print(f"Scatter plot saved to {output_path}")
```

**Output**

```text
Scatter plot saved to public/aim83_scatter_plot.png
```

**Explanation**

- **Scatter Plot**: Each point on a scatter plot represents an observation (in this case, a student) and its position is determined by the values of the two variables being compared (hours studied and exam score). This helps visualize correlation.
- **`plt.scatter(x, y)`**: This function creates the scatter plot. It takes the data for the x-axis and y-axis as arguments.
