### Aim #43: Write a function to count vowels in a string.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to write a function that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) within a given string.

**Python Code**

```python
def count_vowels(input_string):
    """Counts the number of vowels in a string (case-insensitive)."""
    vowels = "aeiou"
    vowel_count = 0
    
    # Convert the input string to lowercase to handle both upper and lower case vowels
    for char in input_string.lower():
        if char in vowels:
            vowel_count += 1
    
    return vowel_count

# --- Test the function ---
text1 = "Hello World"
print(f"The string is: '{text1}'")
print(f"Number of vowels: {count_vowels(text1)}")

text2 = "Programming is fun"
print(f"\nThe string is: '{text2}'")
print(f"Number of vowels: {count_vowels(text2)}")
```

**Output**

```text
The string is: 'Hello World'
Number of vowels: 3

The string is: 'Programming is fun'
Number of vowels: 5
```

**Explanation**

- **Initialization**: We define a string `vowels` containing all the vowels we want to count. We also initialize a `vowel_count` variable to `0`.
- **Case-Insensitive**: We use `input_string.lower()` to create a lowercase version of the input string. This ensures that our function counts both 'A' and 'a' as vowels without needing to check for both explicitly.
- **Looping**: The `for` loop iterates through each character (`char`) in the lowercase string.
- **Checking for Vowels**: Inside the loop, `if char in vowels:` checks if the current character is one of the vowels we defined.
- **Incrementing the Count**: If the character is a vowel, `vowel_count += 1` increments our counter.
- **Return Value**: After the loop has checked all characters, the function returns the final `vowel_count`.
