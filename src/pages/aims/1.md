## Aim #1: Create a list of 10 student names and print them.

### Description
This program demonstrates the fundamental process of creating a list in Python. We initialize a list with ten fictional student names and then use a `for` loop to print each name on a new line.

### Python Code
```python
# A list of 10 student names
student_names = [
    "Aarav Sharma",
    "Vivaan Singh",
    "Aditya Kumar",
    "Diya Patel",
    "Saanvi Gupta",
    "Ananya Reddy",
    "Ishaan Joshi",
    "Riya Mehta",
    "Kabir Shah",
    "Myra Varma"
]

# Print a header for the output
print("List of Students:")

# Loop through each name in the list and print it
for name in student_names:
    print(name)
```

### Output
```text
List of Students:
Aarav Sharma
Vivaan Singh
Aditya Kumar
Diya Patel
Saanvi Gupta
Ananya Reddy
Ishaan Joshi
Riya Mehta
Kabir Shah
Myra Varma
```

### Explanation
- **Variable Declaration:** We start by declaring a variable called `student_names`.
- **List Initialization:** We assign it a **list**, which is a collection of items ordered and changeable. In Python, lists are created by placing items inside square brackets `[]`, separated by commas.
- **Looping:** The **`for name in student_names:`** statement initiates a `for` loop. This is a powerful way to iterate over each item in a sequence (like a list).
- **Printing:** Inside the loop, the `print(name)` command is executed for each item. The variable `name` holds the value of the current student's name in each iteration, which is then printed to the console.
