### Aim #25: Check if a student name exists in the dictionary.

**Description**

This program demonstrates the most common way to check for the existence of a key in a dictionary using the `in` keyword.

**Python Code**

```python
# A dictionary of student marks
student_marks = {
    "Aarav Sharma": 95,
    "Diya Patel": 88,
    "Vivaan Singh": 92
}

# Student to check for
student_to_check = "Diya Patel"

# Use the 'in' keyword to check for key existence
if student_to_check in student_marks:
    print(f"Yes, '{student_to_check}' is in the dictionary.")
else:
    print(f"No, '{student_to_check}' is not in the dictionary.")

# Check for a student who is not in the dictionary
student_to_check = "Kabir Shah"
if student_to_check in student_marks:
    print(f"Yes, '{student_to_check}' is in the dictionary.")
else:
    print(f"No, '{student_to_check}' is not in the dictionary.")
```

**Output**

```text
Yes, 'Diya Patel' is in the dictionary.
No, 'Kabir Shah' is not in the dictionary.
```

**Explanation**

- **The `in` Keyword**: The `in` keyword provides a simple and highly readable way to check if a key is present in a dictionary.
- **How it Works**: The expression `key in dictionary` evaluates to a boolean value: `True` if the key exists in the dictionary, and `False` otherwise.
- **Efficiency**: This is the standard and most efficient way to check for key existence in Python. It's often used in an `if` statement to guard against `KeyError` when accessing or deleting dictionary items.
