### Aim #40: Write a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to write a function that checks if a given string is a **palindrome**. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam", "racecar").

**Python Code**

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    """
    Checks if a string is a palindrome.
    This version is case-sensitive and considers spaces.
    """
    # Reverse the string using slicing [::-1]
    reversed_s = s[::-1]
    
    # Compare the original string with the reversed one
    return s == reversed_s

# --- Test the function ---
word1 = "racecar"
print(f"Is '{word1}' a palindrome? {is_palindrome(word1)}")

word2 = "hello"
print(f"Is '{word2}' a palindrome? {is_palindrome(word2)}")

word3 = "madam"
print(f"Is '{word3}' a palindrome? {is_palindrome(word3)}")
```

**Output**

```text
Is 'racecar' a palindrome? True
Is 'hello' a palindrome? False
Is 'madam' a palindrome? True
```

**Explanation**

- **Function Definition**: We define a function `is_palindrome` that accepts one argument, a string `s`.
- **String Slicing**: The magic happens with `s[::-1]`. This is an extended slice syntax.
    - The first colon separates the start and end index (both are omitted, meaning the whole string).
    - The second colon introduces a "step" value. A step of `-1` means "go backward one character at a time."
    - The result is a new string that is a reversed copy of the original.
- **Comparison**: The function then compares the original string `s` with its reversed version `reversed_s`.
- **Boolean Return**: The `==` operator performs the comparison and evaluates to a boolean value (`True` or `False`), which is then returned by the function.
