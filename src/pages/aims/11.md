### Aim #11: Clear all elements from a list.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to completely empty a list, removing all of its elements. We will use the `clear()` method to empty a list of student names.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list of student names
student_names = [
    "Aarav Sharma",
    "Vivaan Singh",
    "Aditya Kumar",
    "Diya Patel"
]

print(f"Original list: {student_names}")

# The clear() method removes all items from the list
student_names.clear()

print(f"\nList after clearing: {student_names}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original list: ['Aarav Sharma', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Aditya Kumar', 'Diya Patel']

List after clearing: []
```

**Explanation**

- **The `clear()` Method**: The `student_names.clear()` method is called on the list and modifies it *in-place*.
- **Result**: It removes every single element from the list, leaving it as an empty list, represented by `[]`. The list variable `student_names` still exists, but it is now empty.
