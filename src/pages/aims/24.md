### Aim #24: Retrieve marks for a given student.

**Description**

This program shows the primary use of a dictionary: looking up a value using its key. We will also demonstrate a safe way to do this using the `get()` method.

**Python Code**

```python
# A dictionary of student marks
student_marks = {
    "Aarav Sharma": 95,
    "Diya Patel": 88,
    "Vivaan Singh": 92
}

student_to_find = "Vivaan Singh"

# Method 1: Direct access using square brackets []
# This will cause a KeyError if the key is not found.
marks = student_marks[student_to_find]
print(f"Marks for {student_to_find}: {marks}")

# Method 2: Safe access using the .get() method
# This will return None (or a default value) if the key is not found.
student_to_find_safe = "Kabir Shah"
marks_safe = student_marks.get(student_to_find_safe)

print(f"\nSearching for marks for '{student_to_find_safe}'...")
if marks_safe is not None:
    print(f"Marks: {marks_safe}")
else:
    print(f
