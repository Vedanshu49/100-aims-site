### Aim #26: Get all student names as a list from the dictionary.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to extract all the keys (in this case, student names) from a dictionary and store them in a list.

**Python Code**

```python
student_marks = {
    "Aarav Sharma": 95,
    "Diya Patel": 88,
    "Vivaan Singh": 92,
    "Saanvi Gupta": 76
}

print(f"Original dictionary: {student_marks}")

# The .keys() method returns a view object of the dictionary's keys.
# We convert it to a list using the list() constructor.
student_names = list(student_marks.keys())

print(f"\nList of student names (keys): {student_names}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original dictionary: {'Aarav Sharma': 95, 'Diya Patel': 88, 'Vivaan Singh': 92, 'Saanvi Gupta': 76}

List of student names (keys): ['Aarav Sharma', 'Diya Patel', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Saanvi Gupta']
```

**Explanation**

- **The `.keys()` Method**: `dictionary.keys()` returns a special "view object" that displays a list of the dictionary's keys. This view object is dynamic and reflects any changes made to the dictionary.
- **The `list()` Constructor**: To get a regular list that you can store and manipulate independently, you wrap the `.keys()` method call in the `list()` constructor. This creates a new list containing all the keys from the dictionary at that moment.
