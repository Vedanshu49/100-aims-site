### Aim #2: Append 5 new student names to an existing list.

**Description**

This program shows how to add new items to an existing Python list. We start with a list of names and then use the `append()` method in a loop to add five more names to it.

**Python Code**

```python
# An existing list of student names
student_names = [
    "Aarav Sharma",
    "Vivaan Singh",
    "Aditya Kumar",
    "Diya Patel",
    "Saanvi Gupta"
]

# A list of new names to add
new_names = [
    "Ananya Reddy",
    "Ishaan Joshi",
    "Riya Mehta",
    "Kabir Shah",
    "Myra Varma"
]

print("Original list:")
print(student_names)

# Loop through the new names and append each one to the original list
for name in new_names:
    student_names.append(name)

print("\nUpdated list after appending new names:")
print(student_names)
```

**Output**

```text
Original list:
['Aarav Sharma', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Aditya Kumar', 'Diya Patel', 'Saanvi Gupta']

Updated list after appending new names:
['Aarav Sharma', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Aditya Kumar', 'Diya Patel', 'Saanvi Gupta', 'Ananya Reddy', 'Ishaan Joshi', 'Riya Mehta', 'Kabir Shah', 'Myra Varma']
```

**Explanation**

- **Initial List**: We begin with a `student_names` list containing five names.
- **New Data**: A second list, `new_names`, holds the five names we want to add.
- **Iteration**: We use a **`for` loop** to go through each `name` in the `new_names` list.
- **Appending**: Inside the loop, `student_names.append(name)` is the key step. The **`append()`** method is a built-in list function that adds a single item to the very end of the list.
- **Final Result**: After the loop finishes, the `student_names` list has been modified in-place and now contains all ten names. We print the list before and after to show the change.
