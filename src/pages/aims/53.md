### Aim #53: Replace all spaces in a string with underscores.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to replace all occurrences of a specific character or substring within a string using the `.replace()` method.

**Python Code**

```python
sentence = "This is a sample sentence."

print(f"Original sentence: '{sentence}'")

# The .replace() method takes two arguments: the old substring and the new one.
new_sentence = sentence.replace(" ", "_")

print(f"Sentence after replacement: '{new_sentence}'")
```

**Output**

```text
Original sentence: 'This is a sample sentence.'
Sentence after replacement: 'This_is_a_sample_sentence.'
```

**Explanation**

- **`.replace(old, new)` Method**: This string method searches for all occurrences of the `old` substring and replaces them with the `new` substring.
- **Arguments**: In our case, we pass `" "` (a space) as the first argument and `"_"` (an underscore) as the second.
- **New String Created**: The `.replace()` method does not change the original string. It returns a new string with the replacements made. This is a common pattern for all immutable types in Python.
