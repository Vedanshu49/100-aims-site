### Aim #97: Write a recursive function using tuple inputs.

**Description**

This program demonstrates recursion on a tuple. We will write a function that recursively sums all the numbers in a tuple.

**Python Code**

```python
def sum_tuple_recursive(numbers_tuple):
    """Recursively calculates the sum of numbers in a tuple."""
    # Base Case: If the tuple is empty, the sum is 0.
    if not numbers_tuple:
        return 0
    
    # Recursive Step:
    # The sum is the first element plus the sum of the rest of the tuple.
    else:
        # numbers_tuple[0] is the first element
        # numbers_tuple[1:] is a new tuple containing all but the first element
        return numbers_tuple[0] + sum_tuple_recursive(numbers_tuple[1:])

# --- Test the function ---
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
total = sum_tuple_recursive(my_tuple)
print(f"The sum of {my_tuple} is: {total}")

my_tuple = (10, 20, 70)
total = sum_tuple_recursive(my_tuple)
print(f"The sum of {my_tuple} is: {total}")
```

**Output**

```text
The sum of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is: 15
The sum of (10, 20, 70) is: 100
```

**Explanation**

- **Base Case**: The stopping condition is `if not numbers_tuple:`, which checks if the tuple is empty. The sum of an empty tuple is `0`.
- **Recursive Step**: The function breaks the problem down:
    1. It takes the first element (`numbers_tuple[0]`).
    2. It calls itself (`sum_tuple_recursive`) on a smaller version of the problem: the rest of the tuple (`numbers_tuple[1:]`).
    3. It adds the first element to the result of the recursive call.
- **How it Unwinds**: For `sum_tuple_recursive((1, 2, 3))`:
    - It returns `1 + sum_tuple_recursive((2, 3))`
    - which returns `1 + (2 + sum_tuple_recursive((3,)))`
    - which returns `1 + (2 + (3 + sum_tuple_recursive(())))`
    - The base case is hit, returning `0`.
    - The calls resolve: `1 + (2 + (3 + 0)) = 6`.
