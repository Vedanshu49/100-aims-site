### Aim #23: Update marks of a student in the dictionary.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to change the value associated with an existing key in a dictionary.

**Python Code**

```python
# A dictionary of student marks
student_marks = {
    "Aarav Sharma": 95,
    "Diya Patel": 88,
    "Vivaan Singh": 92
}

print(f"Original dictionary: {student_marks}")

# The key of the student whose marks we want to update
student_to_update = "Diya Patel"
new_marks = 91

# Access the key and assign a new value
if student_to_update in student_marks:
    student_marks[student_to_update] = new_marks
    print(f"\nSuccessfully updated marks for '{student_to_update}'.")
else:
    print(f"\nStudent '{student_to_update}' not found.")

print(f"\nUpdated dictionary: {student_marks}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original dictionary: {'Aarav Sharma': 95, 'Diya Patel': 88, 'Vivaan Singh': 92}

Successfully updated marks for 'Diya Patel'.

Updated dictionary: {'Aarav Sharma': 95, 'Diya Patel': 91, 'Vivaan Singh': 92}
```

**Explanation**

- **Updating Values**: The syntax for updating a value is the same as for adding a new one: `dictionary[key] = new_value`.
- **How it Works**: If the key already exists in the dictionary, Python simply replaces the old value associated with that key with the new one. If the key didn't exist, this operation would add it as a new entry instead.
- **Checking for Existence**: As with deletion, it's often wise to check if a key exists with `in` before trying to update it, depending on the program's requirements.
