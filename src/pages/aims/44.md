### Aim #44: Write a function to find the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to generate the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

**Python Code**

```python
def generate_fibonacci(n_terms):
    """Generates the Fibonacci sequence for a given number of terms."""
    if not isinstance(n_terms, int) or n_terms <= 0:
        return "Error: Number of terms must be a positive integer."
    
    # First two terms
    a, b = 0, 1
    fibonacci_sequence = []
    
    for _ in range(n_terms):
        fibonacci_sequence.append(a)
        # The core Fibonacci logic: update the two preceding numbers
        a, b = b, a + b
                
    return fibonacci_sequence

# --- Test the function ---
terms = 10
sequence = generate_fibonacci(terms)
print(f"The Fibonacci sequence for {terms} terms is:")
print(sequence)

terms = 1
sequence = generate_fibonacci(terms)
print(f"\nThe Fibonacci sequence for {terms} term is:")
print(sequence)
```

**Output**

```text
The Fibonacci sequence for 10 terms is:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

The Fibonacci sequence for 1 term is:
[0]
```

**Explanation**

- **Initialization**: We start with `a = 0` and `b = 1`, the first two numbers in the sequence. We also create an empty list `fibonacci_sequence` to store our results.
- **Looping**: The `for` loop runs `n_terms` times to generate the desired number of terms. The `_` is used as a variable name when we don't need to use the loop counter itself.
- **Appending**: In each iteration, we `append` the current value of `a` to our sequence list.
- **The Fibonacci Swap**: The line `a, b = b, a + b` is the heart of the generator. It's an elegant way to perform two assignments at once:
    1. The old value of `b` is assigned to `a`.
    2. The sum of the old `a` and old `b` is assigned to `b`.
- **Example Iteration**:
    - Start: `a=0`, `b=1`. Append `0`. New values: `a=1`, `b=1`.
    - Next: `a=1`, `b=1`. Append `1`. New values: `a=1`, `b=2`.
    - Next: `a=1`, `b=2`. Append `1`. New values: `a=2`, `b=3`.
    - ...and so on.
