### Aim #15: Count the occurrences of a value in a tuple.

**Description**

Similar to lists, tuples also have a `count()` method. This program will use it to count how many times a specific value appears in a tuple.

**Python Code**

```python
# A tuple of student grades
grades_tuple = ('A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'D')

print(f"The tuple of grades is: {grades_tuple}")

# The grade we want to count
target_grade = 'A'

# Use the count() method
count = grades_tuple.count(target_grade)

print(f"\nThe grade '{target_grade}' appears {count} times.")
```

**Output**

```text
The tuple of grades is: ('A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'D')

The grade 'A' appears 3 times.
```

**Explanation**

- **The `count()` Method**: The `count()` method works exactly the same for tuples as it does for lists. It iterates through the tuple, counts every element that matches the provided value (`'A'`), and returns the total.
- **Read-Only Methods**: Methods like `count()` and `index()` are "read-only" operations. They don't modify the tuple, which is why they are allowed on immutable data types. Methods that would change the data, like `append()`, `sort()`, or `clear()`, do not exist for tuples.
