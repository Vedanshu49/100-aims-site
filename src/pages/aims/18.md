### Aim #18: Unpack a tuple into variables.

**Description**

This program demonstrates tuple unpacking, a powerful and elegant feature in Python. It allows you to assign the items of a tuple to multiple variables in a single line of code.

**Python Code**

```python
# A tuple representing a student's data
student_data = ("Aarav Sharma", 16, "Grade 11")

print(f"Original tuple: {student_data}")

# Unpack the tuple into three separate variables
name, age, grade = student_data

print("\n--- Unpacked Variables ---")
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Grade: {grade}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original tuple: ('Aarav Sharma', 16, 'Grade 11')

--- Unpacked Variables ---
Name: Aarav Sharma
Age: 16
Grade: Grade 11
```

**Explanation**

- **Unpacking**: The line `name, age, grade = student_data` is the unpacking assignment. Python takes the elements from the `student_data` tuple in order and assigns them to the variables on the left side of the equals sign.
- **Matching Number of Variables**: For unpacking to work, the number of variables on the left must exactly match the number of elements in the tuple on the right. Otherwise, Python will raise a `ValueError`.
- **Readability**: Unpacking can make code much more readable by giving descriptive names to the elements of a tuple right away.
