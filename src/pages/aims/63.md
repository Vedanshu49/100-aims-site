### Aim #63: Calculate the mean of elements in a NumPy array.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to calculate the mean (average) of all the elements in a NumPy array using its built-in `.mean()` method.

**Python Code**

```python
import numpy as np

marks_array = np.array([88, 95, 72, 100, 65, 82, 95])

print(f"The array of marks is: {marks_array}")

# Use the .mean() method to calculate the average
mean_value = marks_array.mean()

print(f"\nThe mean (average) of the marks is: {mean_value}")
```

**Output**

```text
The array of marks is: [ 88  95  72 100  65  82  95]

The mean (average) of the marks is: 85.28571428571429
```

**Explanation**

- **`.mean()` Method**: NumPy arrays come with many built-in methods for statistical calculations. The `.mean()` method calculates the arithmetic mean (the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements).
- **Efficiency**: Like other NumPy operations, this is implemented in highly optimized, pre-compiled code, making it much faster for large arrays than calculating the mean manually in Python.
- **Other Methods**: NumPy provides many other useful statistical methods, such as `.sum()`, `.min()`, `.max()`, and `.std()` (for standard deviation).
