### Aim #20: Create a dictionary to store student name and marks.

**Description**

This program introduces the **dictionary**, a powerful data structure for storing data as **key-value pairs**. We will create a dictionary to map student names (keys) to their marks (values).

**Python Code**

```python
# A dictionary is created with curly braces {}
# It stores data in key: value pairs.
student_marks = {
    "Aarav Sharma": 95,
    "Diya Patel": 88,
    "Vivaan Singh": 92,
    "Saanvi Gupta": 76
}

print("The dictionary of student marks is:")
print(student_marks)
print(f"\nThe type of the data structure is: {type(student_marks)}")
```

**Output**

```text
The dictionary of student marks is:
{'Aarav Sharma': 95, 'Diya Patel': 88, 'Vivaan Singh': 92, 'Saanvi Gupta': 76}

The type of the data structure is: <class 'dict'>
```

**Explanation**

- **Dictionary Creation**: Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{}`. Each item consists of a `key` and a `value`, separated by a colon (`:`). Items are separated by commas.
- **Keys**: Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, or tuples). They are used to look up the associated value.
- **Values**: Values can be of any data type and can be duplicated.
- **Unordered (Historically)**: In older versions of Python (before 3.7), dictionaries were unordered. Since Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain the order of insertion. However, you should always access items by their key, not by their position.
