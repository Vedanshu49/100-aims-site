### Aim #71: Read data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

**Description**

This program demonstrates one of the most common and powerful features of Pandas: reading data from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file directly into a DataFrame.

**Setup**

This example uses the `student_data.csv` file located in the `public` directory of your project.

**Python Code**

```python
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
# Assumes the CSV file is in the public directory
try:
    df = pd.read_csv("public/student_data.csv")
    print("Successfully loaded data from CSV into DataFrame:")
    print(df)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: student_data.csv not found. Please create the file.")
```

**Output**

```text
Successfully loaded data from CSV into DataFrame:
   StudentID StudentName  Marks  Subject
0        101       Aarav     95     Math
1        102        Diya     88  Science
2        103      Vivaan     92     Math
3        104        Riya     98  English
4        105       Kabir     76  Science
5        106      Saanvi     85  English
```

**Explanation**

- **`pd.read_csv(filepath)`**: This is the primary function for reading data from a CSV file.
- **Functionality**: It's a very powerful function that can handle many different CSV formats. By default, it assumes the first row of the CSV is the header row, which it uses for the column names in the DataFrame.
- **Result**: The function returns a new DataFrame containing all the data from the CSV file, with the columns and rows properly organized.
