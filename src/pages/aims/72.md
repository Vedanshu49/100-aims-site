### Aim #72: Select a column from a DataFrame.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to select and display a single column from a Pandas DataFrame.

**Setup**

This example uses the `student_data.csv` file created in the previous aim.

**Python Code**

```python
import pandas as pd

try:
    df = pd.read_csv("public/student_data.csv")
    
    # Select the 'StudentName' column
    # This returns a Pandas Series
    names_column = df['StudentName']
    
    print("The 'StudentName' column:")
    print(names_column)
    print(f"\nType of the selected column: {type(names_column)}")

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: student_data.csv not found.")
```

**Output**

```text
The 'StudentName' column:
0     Aarav
1      Diya
2    Vivaan
3      Riya
4     Kabir
5    Saanvi
Name: StudentName, dtype: object

Type of the selected column: <class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
```

**Explanation**

- **Square Bracket Notation `[]`**: The most common way to select a column is by using square brackets `[]` with the column's name as a string inside.
- **Pandas Series**: When you select a single column, the result is not another DataFrame, but a **Pandas Series**. A Series is like a 1D array with labels. You can think of a DataFrame as a collection of Series objects that share the same index.
- **Dot Notation**: For columns with simple names (no spaces or special characters), you can also use dot notation, like `df.StudentName`. However, the square bracket method is generally safer and more versatile.
