### Aim #29: Loop through the dictionary and print key-value pairs.

**Description**

This program demonstrates the standard way to iterate through a dictionary to access each key and its corresponding value using the `.items()` method.

**Python Code**

```python
student_marks = {
    "Aarav Sharma": 95,
    "Diya Patel": 88,
    "Vivaan Singh": 92
}

print("Student Marks:")
print("--------------")

# The .items() method returns key-value pairs that can be unpacked.
for student, marks in student_marks.items():
    print(f"Student: {student}, Marks: {marks}")
```

**Output**

```text
Student Marks:
--------------
Student: Aarav Sharma, Marks: 95
Student: Diya Patel, Marks: 88
Student: Vivaan Singh, Marks: 92
```

**Explanation**

- **The `.items()` Method**: `dictionary.items()` returns a view object where each item is a tuple of `(key, value)`.
- **Looping and Unpacking**: In the `for` loop, we use tuple unpacking (`for student, marks in ...`) to assign the first item of the tuple (the key) to the `student` variable and the second item (the value) to the `marks` variable in each iteration.
- **Readability**: This method is highly readable and is the most common and preferred way to loop through dictionaries in Python when you need both the key and the value.
