### Aim #19: Concatenate two tuples.

**Description**

Just like lists, tuples can be concatenated (merged) using the `+` operator. This program will combine two smaller tuples into a single, larger one.

**Python Code**

```python
# Two separate tuples
tuple_one = (1, 2, 3)
tuple_two = ('A', 'B', 'C')

print(f"Tuple one: {tuple_one}")
print(f"Tuple two: {tuple_two}")

# Concatenate the tuples using the + operator
concatenated_tuple = tuple_one + tuple_two

print(f"\nConcatenated tuple: {concatenated_tuple}")
```

**Output**

```text
Tuple one: (1, 2, 3)
Tuple two: ('A', 'B', 'C')

Concatenated tuple: (1, 2, 3, 'A', 'B', 'C')
```

**Explanation**

- **Tuple Concatenation**: The `+` operator, when used with tuples, creates a **new tuple**. This new tuple contains all the elements of the first tuple followed by all the elements of the second tuple.
- **Immutability Preserved**: The original tuples, `tuple_one` and `tuple_two`, are not changed in any way. This is consistent with the immutable nature of tuples; the operation does not modify them but instead creates a new one.
