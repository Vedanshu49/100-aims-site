### Aim #92: Use NumPy to normalize a list of student scores.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to **normalize** a set of scores to a range of 0 to 1. Normalization is a common technique in data preprocessing to bring all values into a common scale. The formula is `(x - min) / (max - min)`.

**Python Code**

```python
import numpy as np

scores = np.array([88, 95, 72, 100, 65, 82])
print(f"Original scores: {scores}")

# Find the minimum and maximum values
min_score = scores.min()
max_score = scores.max()

# Apply the normalization formula
normalized_scores = (scores - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)

print(f"\nNormalized scores (0 to 1):")
# Print formatted to 2 decimal places for readability
print(np.round(normalized_scores, 2))
```

**Output**

```text
Original scores: [ 88  95  72 100  65  82]

Normalized scores (0 to 1):
[0.66 0.86 0.2  1.   0.   0.49]
```

**Explanation**

- **Normalization**: This process rescales numbers so they end up between 0 and 1. The lowest value in the original set becomes 0, the highest value becomes 1, and all other values are transformed to a decimal in between.
- **NumPy Broadcasting**: The line `(scores - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)` is a powerful example of NumPy's **broadcasting**. NumPy automatically subtracts `min_score` from *every* element in the `scores` array, and then divides every element of the result by the range (`max_score - min_score`). This is done efficiently without writing an explicit loop.
