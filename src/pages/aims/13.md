### Aim #13: Access the first and last element of a tuple.

**Description**

This program shows how to access individual elements in a tuple using their index. We will retrieve and print the very first and very last items from a tuple of subjects.

**Python Code**

```python
subjects_tuple = (
    "Mathematics",
    "Physics",
    "Chemistry",
    "Biology",
    "English"
)

print(f"The tuple is: {subjects_tuple}")

# Access the first element at index 0
first_element = subjects_tuple[0]

# Access the last element at index -1
last_element = subjects_tuple[-1]

print(f"\nFirst element: {first_element}")
print(f"Last element: {last_element}")
```

**Output**

```text
The tuple is: ('Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'English')

First element: Mathematics
Last element: English
```

**Explanation**

- **Zero-Indexing**: Just like lists, tuples are zero-indexed, so the first element is always at index `0`.
- **Positive Indexing**: `subjects_tuple[0]` retrieves the element at the start of the tuple.
- **Negative Indexing**: Python supports negative indexing to access elements from the end of a sequence. Index `-1` always refers to the last element, `-2` to the second-to-last, and so on. This is a very convenient way to get the last item without needing to know the tuple's length.
