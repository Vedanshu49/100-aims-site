### Aim #73: Filter rows based on a condition.

**Description**

This program demonstrates one of the most powerful features of Pandas: boolean indexing, which allows you to filter a DataFrame to select only the rows that meet a certain condition.

**Setup**

This example uses the `student_data.csv` file.

**Python Code**

```python
import pandas as pd

try:
    df = pd.read_csv("public/student_data.csv")
    print("Original DataFrame:")
    print(df)

    # Create a boolean condition
    # This creates a Series of True/False values
    condition = df['Marks'] > 90
    
    # Use the condition to filter the DataFrame
    high_scorers = df[condition]
    
    print("\n\nStudents with marks greater than 90:")
    print(high_scorers)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: student_data.csv not found.")
```

**Output**

```text
Original DataFrame:
   StudentID StudentName  Marks  Subject
0        101       Aarav     95     Math
1        102        Diya     88  Science
2        103      Vivaan     92     Math
3        104        Riya     98  English
4        105       Kabir     76  Science
5        106      Saanvi     85  English


Students with marks greater than 90:
   StudentID StudentName  Marks  Subject
0        101       Aarav     95     Math
2        103      Vivaan     92     Math
3        104        Riya     98  English
```

**Explanation**

- **Boolean Series**: The line `df['Marks'] > 90` does not return the marks themselves. Instead, it returns a Pandas Series of boolean (`True`/`False`) values, one for each row. It's `True` where the mark is greater than 90 and `False` otherwise.
- **Boolean Indexing**: When you pass this boolean Series inside the square brackets of the DataFrame (`df[condition]`), Pandas returns a new DataFrame containing only the rows where the boolean Series had a `True` value. This is an incredibly powerful and efficient way to filter data.
