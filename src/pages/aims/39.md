### Aim #39: Write a function to calculate factorial of a number.

**Description**

This program introduces **functions**. We will write a function that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer. The factorial of a number `n` (written as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers up to `n`. For example, `5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.

**Python Code**

```python
def calculate_factorial(n):
    """Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer."""
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        return "Error: Input must be a non-negative integer."

    # Factorial of 0 is 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize result
    factorial_result = 1
    # Multiply from 1 up to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        factorial_result *= i
    
    return factorial_result

# --- Test the function ---
number = 5
result = calculate_factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {result}")

number = 0
result = calculate_factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {result}")

number = -3
result = calculate_factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is: {result}")
```

**Output**

```text
The factorial of 5 is: 120
The factorial of 0 is: 1
The factorial of -3 is: Error: Input must be a non-negative integer.
```

**Explanation**

- **`def` Keyword**: We define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name (`calculate_factorial`) and its parameters in parentheses (`n`).
- **Docstring**: The string right after the function definition is a **docstring**, which explains what the function does.
- **Input Validation**: The first `if` statement checks if the input `n` is a valid non-negative integer. This is good practice to prevent errors.
- **Base Case**: The factorial of `0` is defined as `1`. Our second `if` statement handles this special case.
- **Looping**: The `for` loop iterates from `1` up to `n` (inclusive). The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates this sequence of numbers.
- **Calculation**: Inside the loop, `factorial_result *= i` is shorthand for `factorial_result = factorial_result * i`. It multiplies the current result by the next number in the sequence.
- **`return` Statement**: The `return` keyword exits the function and sends back the final calculated value.
