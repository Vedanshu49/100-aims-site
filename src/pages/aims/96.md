### Aim #96: Use sets to find students who attended two different classes.

**Description**

This program provides a practical example of using set intersection to find the common elements between two collections of data.

**Python Code**

```python
# Rosters for two different classes
math_class = {"Aarav", "Diya", "Vivaan", "Riya", "Kabir"}
science_class = {"Diya", "Ishaan", "Riya", "Saanvi", "Aarav"}

print(f"Math Class Roster: {math_class}")
print(f"Science Class Roster: {science_class}")

# Find the intersection of the two sets
both_classes = math_class.intersection(science_class)
# Alternatively: both_classes = math_class & science_class

print(f"\nStudents in both classes: {both_classes}")
```

**Output**

```text
Math Class Roster: {'Vivaan', 'Riya', 'Aarav', 'Kabir', 'Diya'}
Science Class Roster: {'Saanvi', 'Riya', 'Aarav', 'Ishaan', 'Diya'}

Students in both classes: {'Aarav', 'Riya', 'Diya'}
```

**Explanation**

- **Sets for Uniqueness**: Using sets is ideal for this problem because we are only concerned with the unique names in each class roster.
- **`.intersection()`**: As we saw in Aim #36, the `.intersection()` method (or the `&` operator) is the perfect tool for this job. It efficiently compares the two sets and returns a new set containing only the elements that are present in both.

```
