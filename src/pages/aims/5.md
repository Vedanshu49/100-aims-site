### Aim #5: Reverse the order of elements in a list.

**Description**

This program shows how to reverse the order of elements in a list. We will use the built-in `reverse()` method, which flips the order of elements so the last item becomes the first, and the first becomes the last.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list of student names
student_names = [
    "Aarav Sharma",
    "Vivaan Singh",
    "Aditya Kumar",
    "Diya Patel",
    "Saanvi Gupta"
]

print("Original list:")
print(student_names)

# The reverse() method reverses the list in place
student_names.reverse()

print("\nList after reversing:")
print(student_names)
```

**Output**

```text
Original list:
['Aarav Sharma', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Aditya Kumar', 'Diya Patel', 'Saanvi Gupta']

List after reversing:
['Saanvi Gupta', 'Diya Patel', 'Aditya Kumar', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Aarav Sharma']
```

**Explanation**

- **Initial List**: We begin with an ordered list of five student names.
- **The `reverse()` Method**: The line `student_names.reverse()` modifies the list *in-place*. This means it doesn't create a new list; it directly changes the order of elements within the `student_names` list itself.
- **Final Result**: After `reverse()` is called, the original first element ("Aarav Sharma") is now the last, and the original last element ("Saanvi Gupta") is now the first. The entire order of the list is flipped.
