### Aim #34: Remove a student name from the set.

**Description**

This program demonstrates two ways to remove an element from a set: using `.remove()` (which can cause an error) and `.discard()` (which is safer).

**Python Code**

```python
student_set = {"Aarav", "Diya", "Vivaan", "Riya"}
print(f"Original set: {student_set}")

# Method 1: Using .remove()
# This will raise a KeyError if the item is not found.
student_set.remove("Diya")
print(f"\nSet after removing 'Diya': {student_set}")

# Method 2: Using .discard()
# This will NOT raise an error if the item is not found.
student_set.discard("Vivaan")
print(f"Set after discarding 'Vivaan': {student_set}")

# Try to discard an item that doesn't exist
student_set.discard("Kabir")
print(f"Set after discarding 'Kabir' (no error): {student_set}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original set: {'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Riya', 'Diya'}

Set after removing 'Diya': {'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Riya'}
Set after discarding 'Vivaan': {'Aarav', 'Riya'}
Set after discarding 'Kabir' (no error): {'Aarav', 'Riya'}
```

**Explanation**

- **`.remove(element)`**: This method removes the specified element from the set. If the element is not found, it raises a `KeyError`. You should use this when you expect the item to be present and want your program to fail if it's not.
- **`.discard(element)`**: This method also removes the specified element. However, if the element is not found in the set, it does nothing and does not raise an error. This is the safer option when you're not sure if the item exists.
