### Aim #62: Perform element-wise addition of two arrays.

**Description**

This program demonstrates one of the most powerful features of NumPy: the ability to perform fast, element-wise operations. We will add two arrays together.

**Python Code**

```python
import numpy as np

array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([10, 20, 30])

print(f"Array 1: {array1}")
print(f"Array 2: {array2}")

# Add the two arrays together
# The operation is performed element by element.
sum_array = array1 + array2

print(f"\nSum of the two arrays: {sum_array}")
```

**Output**

```text
Array 1: [1 2 3]
Array 2: [10 20 30]

Sum of the two arrays: [11 22 33]
```

**Explanation**

- **Element-Wise Operation**: When you use standard arithmetic operators like `+` between two NumPy arrays of the same shape, the operation is applied to each pair of corresponding elements.
- **How it Works**:
    - The first element of `array1` (1) is added to the first element of `array2` (10) to get 11.
    - The second element of `array1` (2) is added to the second element of `array2` (20) to get 22.
    - ...and so on.
- **Broadcasting**: This is a simple example of a concept called "broadcasting" in NumPy. It allows NumPy to perform these operations efficiently without you needing to write a manual `for` loop.
