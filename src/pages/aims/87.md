### Aim #87: Create a pie chart of grade distribution.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to create a pie chart, which is useful for showing the proportion of different categories that make up a whole.

**Python Code**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data for the pie chart
grades = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F']
num_students = [15, 25, 20, 8, 2] # Number of students who received each grade

# Explode the 'A' grade slice slightly
explode = (0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0)

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 7))
plt.pie(
    num_students, 
    labels=grades, 
    explode=explode,
    autopct='%1.1f%%', # Format to show percentage with one decimal place
    shadow=True,
    startangle=140
)

plt.title('Grade Distribution')
plt.axis('equal') # Ensures the pie chart is a circle.

output_path = 'public/aim87_pie_chart.png'
plt.savefig(output_path)

print(f"Pie chart saved to {output_path}")
```

**Output**

```text
Pie chart saved to public/aim87_pie_chart.png
```

**Explanation**

- **`plt.pie(sizes, labels)`**: This is the function for creating a pie chart. The first argument is a list of values (the size of each slice), and the `labels` argument provides the name for each slice.
- **`explode`**: This argument is a tuple that specifies the fraction of the radius with which to offset each wedge. It's used to make a slice "pop out".
- **`autopct`**: This is a formatted string that determines how the percentage value is displayed on each slice. `%1.1f%%` means a floating-point number with one decimal place, followed by a percent sign.
- **`plt.axis('equal')`**: This ensures that the pie chart is drawn as a perfect circle, not an ellipse.
