### Aim #7: Count the occurrence of a specific item in a list.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to count how many times a specific item appears in a list. We will use the `count()` method to find the number of times the mark `95` appears in our list.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list of student marks with some duplicates
marks = [88, 95, 72, 100, 65, 82, 95, 95]

print(f"The list of marks is: {marks}")

# The mark we want to count
target_mark = 95

# Use the count() method
count = marks.count(target_mark)

print(f"\nThe mark '{target_mark}' appears {count} times in the list.")
```

**Output**

```text
The list of marks is: [88, 95, 72, 100, 65, 82, 95, 95]

The mark '95' appears 3 times in the list.
```

**Explanation**

- **The `count()` Method**: The line `marks.count(target_mark)` scans the entire list and counts every element that is equal to the value of `target_mark` (which is `95`).
- **Return Value**: The method returns the total count as an integer. If the item is not found in the list, it simply returns `0`.
