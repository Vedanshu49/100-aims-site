### Aim #4: Sort a list of student marks in ascending order.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to sort a list of numbers. We will use the built-in `sort()` method to rearrange a list of student marks from the lowest value to the highest.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list of student marks
marks = [88, 95, 72, 100, 65, 82, 95]

print("Original list of marks:")
print(marks)

# The sort() method sorts the list in place
marks.sort()

print("\nList of marks after sorting:")
print(marks)
```

**Output**

```text
Original list of marks:
[88, 95, 72, 100, 65, 82, 95]

List of marks after sorting:
[65, 72, 82, 88, 95, 95, 100]
```

**Explanation**

- **Initial List**: We start with a list named `marks` containing integer values representing student scores.
- **The `sort()` Method**: The line `marks.sort()` is where the action happens. The **`sort()`** method is called directly on the list and modifies it *in-place*. This means it rearranges the elements within the original `marks` list itself.
- **Ascending Order**: By default, `sort()` arranges the elements in ascending order (from smallest to largest).
- **Final Result**: When we print the `marks` list again, it shows the elements reordered from 65 to 100.
