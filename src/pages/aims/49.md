### Aim #49: Write a recursive function to compute power of a number.

**Description**

This program demonstrates **recursion** by creating a function that calculates the power of a number (`base^exponent`). A recursive function is one that calls itself.

**Python Code**

```python
def power_recursive(base, exponent):
    """Calculates power using recursion."""
    # Base case: any number to the power of 0 is 1
    if exponent == 0:
        return 1
    # Recursive step
    else:
        return base * power_recursive(base, exponent - 1)

# --- Test the function ---
base_num = 3
exp_num = 4
result = power_recursive(base_num, exp_num)
print(f"{base_num} to the power of {exp_num} is: {result}") # Expected: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81

base_num = 5
exp_num = 3
result = power_recursive(base_num, exp_num)
print(f"{base_num} to the power of {exp_num} is: {result}") # Expected: 5 * 5 * 5 = 125
```

**Output**

```text
3 to the power of 4 is: 81
5 to the power of 3 is: 125
```

**Explanation**

- **Recursion**: This function solves the problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. The power `base^exponent` is the same as `base * base^(exponent-1)`.
- **Base Case**: The `if exponent == 0:` condition is the **base case**. This is the crucial stopping condition for the recursion. Without it, the function would call itself forever. It defines the simplest possible problem: any number to the power of 0 is 1.
- **Recursive Step**: The `else` block contains the **recursive step**. It returns the `base` multiplied by the result of calling the *same function* with a slightly smaller exponent (`exponent - 1`).
- **How it Unwinds**: For `power_recursive(3, 4)`:
    - It returns `3 * power_recursive(3, 3)`
    - which returns `3 * (3 * power_recursive(3, 2))`
    - which returns `3 * (3 * (3 * power_recursive(3, 1)))`
    - which returns `3 * (3 * (3 * (3 * power_recursive(3, 0))))`
    - The base case is hit: `power_recursive(3, 0)` returns `1`.
    - The calls then resolve: `3*3*3*3*1 = 81`.
