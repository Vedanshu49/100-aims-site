### Aim #47: Write a function to calculate the area of a rectangle.

**Description**

This program demonstrates a simple function to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width. The formula for the area is `length Ã— width`.

**Python Code**

```python
def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width):
    """Calculates the area of a rectangle."""
    if length < 0 or width < 0:
        return "Error: Length and width must be non-negative."
    
    area = length * width
    return area

# --- Test the function ---
rect_length = 10
rect_width = 5
area = calculate_rectangle_area(rect_length, rect_width)

print(f"A rectangle with length {rect_length} and width {rect_width} has an area of: {area}")

rect_length = 15.5
rect_width = 10
area = calculate_rectangle_area(rect_length, rect_width)

print(f"A rectangle with length {rect_length} and width {rect_width} has an area of: {area}")
```

**Output**

```text
A rectangle with length 10 and width 5 has an area of: 50
A rectangle with length 15.5 and width 10 has an area of: 155.0
```

**Explanation**

- **Function Definition**: We define a function `calculate_rectangle_area` that accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`.
- **Input Validation**: A simple check is included to ensure the dimensions are not negative numbers.
- **Calculation**: The core logic is `area = length * width`, which implements the mathematical formula.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated `area`. The function works for both integers and floating-point numbers.
