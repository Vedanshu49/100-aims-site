### Aim #56: Split a string into a list based on a delimiter.

**Description**

This program demonstrates the `.split()` method's ability to break a string into a list of substrings using a specific character (a "delimiter").

**Python Code**

```python
# A string of comma-separated values
csv_string = "apple,banana,cherry,date,elderberry"

print(f"Original string: '{csv_string}'")

# Split the string by the comma delimiter
fruit_list = csv_string.split(',')

print(f"List after splitting by ',': {fruit_list}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original string: 'apple,banana,cherry,date,elderberry'
List after splitting by ',': ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
```

**Explanation**

- **`.split(delimiter)` Method**: When you provide an argument to the `.split()` method, it uses that argument as the delimiter to decide where to make the cuts in the string.
- **Delimiter**: In this case, we use a comma (`,`) as the delimiter. The method finds every comma in the string and splits the string into a new substring at each one.
- **Result**: The result is a list of strings. The delimiters themselves are not included in the resulting list. This technique is fundamental for parsing data from formats like CSV (Comma-Separated Values).
