### Aim #55: Extract a substring from a string.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to extract a portion of a string, known as a **substring**, using slicing. This is the same slicing technique used for lists and tuples.

**Python Code**

```python
main_string = "Hello, welcome to the world of Python!"

print(f"Original string: '{main_string}'")

# Extract the word "welcome"
# Index of 'w' is 7, index of 'e' is 13. We go up to 14.
substring1 = main_string[7:14]
print(f"Substring from index 7 to 14: '{substring1}'")

# Extract the word "Python"
# Index of 'P' is 28. We can omit the end index to go to the end.
substring2 = main_string[28:]
print(f"Substring from index 28 to the end: '{substring2}'")
```

**Output**

```text
Original string: 'Hello, welcome to the world of Python!'
Substring from index 7 to 14: 'welcome'
Substring from index 28 to the end: 'Python!'
```

**Explanation**

- **Slicing `[start:end]`**: String slicing uses the same `[start:end]` syntax as lists.
- **`start` (Inclusive)**: The index of the first character you want to include.
- **`end` (Exclusive)**: The index of the first character you *don't* want to include. `main_string[7:14]` includes characters at indices 7 through 13.
- **Omitting Indices**:
    - If you omit the `start` index (`[:14]`), the slice starts from the beginning of the string.
    - If you omit the `end` index (`[28:]`), the slice goes all the way to the end of the string.
