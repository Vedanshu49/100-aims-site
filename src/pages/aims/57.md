### Aim #57: Join a list of strings into a single string.

**Description**

This program demonstrates the `.join()` method, which is the inverse of `.split()`. It takes a list of strings and concatenates them into a single string, with a specified separator between each element.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list of words
word_list = ["Python", "is", "a", "powerful", "language"]

print(f"Original list: {word_list}")

# Join the list into a string with spaces in between
separator = " "
sentence = separator.join(word_list)
print(f"\nJoined with a space: '{sentence}'")

# Join the list with a different separator
separator = " - "
dashed_sentence = separator.join(word_list)
print(f"Joined with ' - ': '{dashed_sentence}'")
```

**Output**

```text
Original list: ['Python', 'is', 'a', 'powerful', 'language']

Joined with a space: 'Python is a powerful language'
Joined with ' - ': 'Python - is - a - powerful - language'
```

**Explanation**

- **`separator.join(list)` Syntax**: The syntax for `.join()` can seem unusual at first. The method is called on the *separator string* itself, and it takes the list as an argument.
- **How it Works**: It iterates through the list and builds a new string by placing the separator string between each adjacent element from the list.
- **Efficiency**: This is the most efficient and standard way to build a string from a list of substrings in Python.
