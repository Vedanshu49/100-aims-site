### Aim #42: Write a function to sum all elements in a list.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list using Python's built-in `sum()` function.

**Python Code**

```python
def sum_list_elements(numbers):
    """
    Calculates the sum of all numbers in a list.
    """
    return sum(numbers)

# --- Test the function ---
my_marks = [88, 92, 75, 100, 65]
total = sum_list_elements(my_marks)

print(f"The list of marks is: {my_marks}")
print(f"The sum of all marks is: {total}")

my_numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = sum_list_elements(my_numbers)

print(f"\nThe list of numbers is: {my_numbers}")
print(f"The sum of all numbers is: {total}")
```

**Output**

```text
The list of marks is: [88, 92, 75, 100, 65]
The sum of all marks is: 420

The list of numbers is: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
The sum of all numbers is: 150
```

**Explanation**

- **Function Definition**: We define a function `sum_list_elements` that takes one argument, a list called `numbers`.
- **Built-in `sum()` function**: Python's `sum()` function is designed specifically for this purpose. It takes an iterable (like a list or tuple) of numbers as an argument and returns their total sum.
- **Efficiency**: Using the built-in `sum()` is the standard, most readable, and most efficient way to sum the elements of a list in Python.
