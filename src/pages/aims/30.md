### Aim #30: Merge two dictionaries containing student data.

**Description**

This program shows a modern way to merge two dictionaries into a single new dictionary using the `|` (union) operator.

**Python Code**

```python
# Two dictionaries with student data
dict_class_A = {
    "Aarav": 95,
    "Diya": 88
}
dict_class_B = {
    "Vivaan": 92,
    "Saanvi": 76,
    "Aarav": 98 # Note: This key also exists in dict_class_A
}

print(f"Class A: {dict_class_A}")
print(f"Class B: {dict_class_B}")

# Merge the dictionaries using the | operator (available in Python 3.9+)
merged_dict = dict_class_A | dict_class_B

print(f"\nMerged Dictionary: {merged_dict}")
```

**Output**

```text
Class A: {'Aarav': 95, 'Diya': 88}
Class B: {'Vivaan': 92, 'Saanvi': 76, 'Aarav': 98}

Merged Dictionary: {'Diya': 88, 'Vivaan': 92, 'Saanvi': 76, 'Aarav': 98}
```

**Explanation**

- **The Union Operator `|`**: Introduced in Python 3.9, the pipe `|` operator is a clean and readable way to merge two dictionaries. It creates a new dictionary containing the items from both.
- **Handling Duplicate Keys**: If a key exists in both dictionaries (like "Aarav" in our example), the value from the **second** (right-hand) dictionary will be used in the final merged dictionary. Notice how Aarav's mark is `98` in the result, which comes from `dict_class_B`.
- **Alternative (Older Python)**: In Python versions before 3.9, you would typically use the `update()` method or dictionary unpacking (`{**dict1, **dict2}`).
