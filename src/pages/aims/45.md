### Aim #45: Write a function to check if a number is prime.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to write a function to determine if a given number is a **prime number**. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Python Code**

```python
import math

def is_prime(num):
    """Checks if a number is prime."""
    # Prime numbers must be greater than 1
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    
    # Check for factors from 2 up to the square root of the number
    # We only need to check up to the square root for efficiency.
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            # If we find a factor, it's not a prime number
            return False
    
    # If no factors were found, it is a prime number
    return True

# --- Test the function ---
number1 = 29
print(f"Is {number1} a prime number? {is_prime(number1)}")

number2 = 15
print(f"Is {number2} a prime number? {is_prime(number2)}")

number3 = 2
print(f"Is {number3} a prime number? {is_prime(number3)}")

number4 = 1
print(f"Is {number4} a prime number? {is_prime(number4)}")
```

**Output**

```text
Is 29 a prime number? True
Is 15 a prime number? False
Is 2 a prime number? True
Is 1 a prime number? False
```

**Explanation**

- **Base Case**: The first `if` statement handles the basic definition: numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime.
- **Efficient Looping**: We loop from `2` up to the square root of the number (`int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1`). We don't need to check for factors beyond the square root, which makes the function much more efficient for large numbers.
- **Modulo Operator `%`**: The expression `num % i == 0` uses the modulo operator to check for a remainder. If the remainder is `0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `num`, and therefore `num` cannot be prime.
- **Early Exit**: If a factor is found, we immediately `return False` and exit the function. There's no need to check further.
- **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding any factors, it means the number is only divisible by 1 and itself, so we `return True`.
