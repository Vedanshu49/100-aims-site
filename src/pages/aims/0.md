## Aim #0: A Detailed Guide to Python Fundamentals

**Description**

This page is a comprehensive guide to the core concepts of Python programming. Think of it as your reference sheet for understanding the building blocks used in all 100 aims. We will take a deeper dive into variables, data types, operators, data structures, control flow, and functions.

### Variables: The Building Blocks of Data

In programming, a **variable** is like a labeled box where you can store a piece of information. You give the box a name (the variable name) and put something inside it (the value). You can change the contents of the box later.

- **Naming Rules:** Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`). They can't start with a number and are case-sensitive (`age` is different from `Age`).
- **Best Practice:** Use descriptive names that indicate what the variable stores. This is called "self-commenting code." For example, use `student_name` instead of `sn`.

```python
# Assigning values to variables
student_name = "Riya Mehta"
student_age = 19
registration_fee = 25.50
is_enrolled = True

# We can print these variables to see their values
print(student_name)
print(student_age)
```

### Data Types: The Nature of Information

Every value in Python has a "type." This tells Python what kind of data it is and what you can do with it.

#### A. Primitive Types
- **String (`str`):** Used for text. Defined with single quotes (`'...'`) or double quotes (`"..."`).
- **Integer (`int`):** Used for whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5, 0).
- **Float (`float`):** Used for numbers with a decimal point (e.g., 3.14, -0.5).
- **Boolean (`bool`):** Represents one of two values: `True` or `False`. Crucial for making decisions.

#### B. String Manipulation

Strings are powerful and have many built-in methods.

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"

# Get length of string
print(len(greeting)) # Output: 13

# Convert to upper/lower case
print(greeting.upper()) # Output: HELLO, WORLD!
print(greeting.lower()) # Output: hello, world!

# F-Strings (Formatted Strings) - The modern way to embed variables
name = "Aarav"
age = 20
print(f"{name} is {age} years old.") # Output: Aarav is 20 years old.
```

### Data Structures: Organizing Collections of Data

These are special variables that can hold multiple values at once.

#### A. Lists `[]`

A **list** is like a numbered list of items. It's ordered (items have a specific position) and mutable (you can change, add, and remove items).

```python
# A list of subjects
subjects = ["Physics", "Chemistry", "Math"]

# Accessing items by index (starts at 0)
print(subjects[0]) # Output: Physics

# Adding an item to the end
subjects.append("Biology")
print(subjects) # Output: ['Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Math', 'Biology']

# Removing an item
subjects.remove("Chemistry")
print(subjects) # Output: ['Physics', 'Math', 'Biology']
```

#### B. Tuples `()`

A **tuple** is similar to a list, but it's **immutable**, meaning you cannot change its contents after it's created. This makes it reliable for data that shouldn't be modified, like coordinates (x, y).

```python
# A tuple of RGB color values
primary_colors = (255, 0, 0) # Red

# You can access elements just like a list
print(primary_colors[0]) # Output: 255

# But you CANNOT change them. This line would cause an error:
# primary_colors[0] = 100  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

#### C. Dictionaries `{}`

A **dictionary** is like a real-world dictionary. It stores information in **key-value pairs**. Instead of looking up an item by its index number, you look it up by its unique key. It's incredibly useful for storing structured information.

```python
# A dictionary representing a student
student_profile = {
    "name": "Saanvi Gupta",
    "id": 1024,
    "marks": [88, 92, 79]
}

# Accessing a value by its key
print(student_profile["name"]) # Output: Saanvi Gupta

# Adding a new key-value pair
student_profile["grade"] = "A"
print(student_profile)
# Output: {'name': 'Saanvi Gupta', 'id': 1024, 'marks': [88, 92, 79], 'grade': 'A'}
```

#### D. Sets `{}`

A **set** is an unordered collection of items where every element must be **unique**. They are great for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or performing mathematical set operations (union, intersection).

```python
# A list with duplicate numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]

# Convert the list to a set to get unique elements
unique_numbers = set(numbers)
print(unique_numbers) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### Control Flow: Directing the Path of Your Program

#### A. Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)

These statements allow your program to make decisions. It's like giving your code a choice: "If this condition is true, do this; otherwise, do that."

```python
temperature = 25

if temperature > 30:
    print("It's a hot day.")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's a pleasant day.")
else:
    print("It's a cold day.")
# Output will be: It's a pleasant day.
```

#### B. Loops (`for` and `while`)

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times without rewriting it.

A **`for` loop** is used for iterating over a sequence (like a list or a string). Think of it as "for each item in this collection, do something."

```python
# Looping through a list of fruits
fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like to eat {fruit}")
```

A **`while` loop** is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. Think of it as "while this condition holds, keep doing this."

```python
# A simple countdown
countdown = 5
while countdown > 0:
    print(countdown)
    countdown = countdown - 1 # or countdown -= 1
print("Blast off!")
```

### Functions: Creating Reusable Code

A **function** is a named, reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Defining functions helps you organize your code, avoid repetition, and make your programs more modular.

- **`def` keyword:** Used to define a new function.
- **Parameters:** Variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They are the inputs the function needs.
- **`return` statement:** Exits the function and optionally passes a value back to where the function was called.

```python
# A function to calculate the area of a rectangle
def calculate_area(length, width):
    area = length * width
    return area

# Call the function with arguments (the actual values)
room_area = calculate_area(10, 5)
print(f"The area of the room is {room_area} square units.") # Output: 50
```
