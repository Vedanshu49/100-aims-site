### Aim #80: Plot a line graph of student scores.

**Description**

This program introduces data visualization with **Matplotlib**, a popular plotting library. We will create a simple line graph to visualize student marks.

**Python Code**

```python
# First, you need to have Matplotlib installed:
# pip install matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

students = ['Aarav', 'Diya', 'Vivaan', 'Riya', 'Kabir']
marks = [95, 88, 92, 98, 76]

# Create the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5)) # Set the figure size
plt.plot(students, marks, marker='o') # 'o' creates circles at data points

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Student Marks')
plt.xlabel('Student Names')
plt.ylabel('Marks Obtained')

# Add a grid for better readability
plt.grid(True)

# Display the plot
# In a script, this opens a window. In notebooks, it displays inline.
# For this project, we will save it to a file instead.
output_path = 'public/aim80_line_graph.png'
plt.savefig(output_path)

print(f"Line graph saved to {output_path}")
```

**Output**

```text
Line graph saved to public/aim80_line_graph.png
```

![Line Graph of Student Marks](/aim80_line_graph.png)

**Explanation**

- **Importing**: The standard convention is to `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.
- **`plt.figure()`**: This creates a figure object, which is the container for the plot. We can set its size.
- **`plt.plot(x, y)`**: This is the main function for creating a line plot. It takes the x-axis data and y-axis data as arguments. We also added `marker='o'` to clearly show the data points on the line.
- **Labels and Title**: Functions like `plt.title()`, `plt.xlabel()`, and `plt.ylabel()` are used to add descriptive labels to the plot, which is crucial for making it understandable.
- **`plt.savefig(path)`**: Instead of displaying the plot in a window with `plt.show()`, we use `plt.savefig()` to save the generated plot as an image file. This is essential for web projects.
