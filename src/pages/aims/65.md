### Aim #65: Reshape a 1D array into 2D.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to change the shape of a NumPy array. We will take a flat, one-dimensional array and reshape it into a two-dimensional (3x3) matrix.

**Python Code**

```python
import numpy as np

# A 1D array with 9 elements
flat_array = np.arange(1, 10) # Creates an array [1, 2, ..., 9]

print(f"Original 1D array:\n{flat_array}")
print(f"Original shape: {flat_array.shape}")

# Reshape the array into a 3x3 matrix
# The new shape must be compatible with the original number of elements (3*3=9)
reshaped_array = flat_array.reshape(3, 3)

print(f"\nReshaped 2D array (3x3 matrix):\n{reshaped_array}")
print(f"New shape: {reshaped_array.shape}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original 1D array:
[1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
Original shape: (9,)

Reshaped 2D array (3x3 matrix):
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
New shape: (3, 3)
```

**Explanation**

- **`np.arange()`**: This is a handy NumPy function for creating an array with a sequence of numbers. `np.arange(1, 10)` creates an array starting at 1 and ending just before 10.
- **`.reshape(rows, columns)`**: The `.reshape()` method returns a new array with the same data but a different shape.
- **Compatibility**: The total number of elements must remain the same. You can reshape a 9-element array into a 3x3 matrix because `3 * 3 = 9`. You could not reshape it into a 3x4 matrix, as that would require 12 elements.
- **New View**: `.reshape()` often returns a "view" of the original array, not a copy. This means changing an element in the new reshaped array might also change the element in the original flat array.
