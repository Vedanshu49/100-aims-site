### Aim #10: Replace an element at a specific index in a list.

**Description**

This program shows how to change or replace an element at a specific position in a list. We will target the element at index `2` and assign it a new value.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list of student names
student_names = [
    "Aarav Sharma",
    "Vivaan Singh",
    "Aditya Kumar", # We will replace this element
    "Diya Patel",
    "Saanvi Gupta"
]

print(f"Original list: {student_names}")

# The index to modify
target_index = 2
new_name = "Ishaan Joshi"

# Access the element at the target index and assign a new value
student_names[target_index] = new_name

print(f"\nUpdated list: {student_names}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original list: ['Aarav Sharma', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Aditya Kumar', 'Diya Patel', 'Saanvi Gupta']

Updated list: ['Aarav Sharma', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Ishaan Joshi', 'Diya Patel', 'Saanvi Gupta']
```

**Explanation**

- **Mutability**: Lists in Python are **mutable**, which means you can change their content after they are created.
- **Index Assignment**: To replace an element, you access it via its index in square brackets (e.g., `student_names[2]`) and use the assignment operator (`=`) to give it a new value.
- **In-Place Modification**: This operation modifies the list directly in-place. The original "Aditya Kumar" at index `2` is replaced by "Ishaan Joshi".
