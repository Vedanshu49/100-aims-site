### Aim #93: Write a function that accepts a dictionary and returns students with marks above a threshold.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to filter a dictionary based on its values. The function will return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs that meet a certain criteria (marks above a threshold).

**Python Code**

```python
def get_high_scorers(marks_dict, threshold):
    """
    Filters a dictionary to find students with marks above a threshold.
    Returns a new dictionary.
    """
    high_scorers = {}
    for student, mark in marks_dict.items():
        if mark > threshold:
            high_scorers[student] = mark
    return high_scorers

# --- Test the function ---
student_marks = {
    "Aarav": 95, "Diya": 88, "Vivaan": 92, "Riya": 98, "Kabir": 76
}
score_threshold = 90

top_students = get_high_scorers(student_marks, score_threshold)

print(f"Original marks: {student_marks}")
print(f"Students with marks above {score_threshold}: {top_students}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original marks: {'Aarav': 95, 'Diya': 88, 'Vivaan': 92, 'Riya': 98, 'Kabir': 76}
Students with marks above 90: {'Aarav': 95, 'Vivaan': 92, 'Riya': 98}
```

**Explanation**

- **Function Definition**: The function `get_high_scorers` takes a dictionary and a numerical `threshold` as input.
- **Initialization**: It starts by creating a new, empty dictionary called `high_scorers`.
- **Iteration**: It loops through the input dictionary `marks_dict` using the `.items()` method to get each `student` (key) and `mark` (value).
- **Conditional Logic**: Inside the loop, `if mark > threshold:` checks if the current student's mark is greater than the specified threshold.
- **Building the New Dictionary**: If the condition is true, the student and their mark are added as a new key-value pair to the `high_scorers` dictionary.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the new `high_scorers` dictionary, which contains only the filtered results.
