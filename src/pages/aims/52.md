### Aim #52: Count the number of words in a sentence.

**Description**

This program demonstrates a simple way to count the number of words in a sentence by splitting the string into a list of words and then finding the length of the list.

**Python Code**

```python
sentence = "This is a sample sentence for our program."

print(f"The sentence is: '{sentence}'")

# The .split() method breaks the string into a list of words
# By default, it splits by whitespace.
words = sentence.split()

# The len() function gives us the number of items in the list
word_count = len(words)

print(f"The number of words in the sentence is: {word_count}")
```

**Output**

```text
The sentence is: 'This is a sample sentence for our program.'
The number of words in the sentence is: 8
```

**Explanation**

- **`.split()` Method**: The `string.split()` method is a powerful tool for breaking a string into a list. When called without arguments, it splits the string at any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) and discards empty strings.
- **List of Words**: The result of `sentence.split()` is a list where each item is a word from the original sentence.
- **`len()` Function**: We then use the familiar `len()` function to count the number of items in the `words` list, which gives us the total word count.
