### Aim #14: Demonstrate immutability of tuples by attempting modification.

**Description**

This program highlights the key difference between tuples and lists: **immutability**. We will try to change an element in a tuple and observe the error Python produces, proving that tuples cannot be modified after creation.

**Python Code**

```python
subjects_tuple = (
    "Mathematics",
    "Physics",
    "Chemistry",
    "Biology",
    "English"
)

print(f"Original tuple: {subjects_tuple}")

# Attempt to change the element at index 2
try:
    subjects_tuple[2] = "History"
    print("Successfully modified the tuple.")
except TypeError as e:
    print("\nAn error occurred:")
    print(f"Error message: {e}")
    print("\nThis demonstrates that tuples are immutable and cannot be changed.")
```

**Output**

```text
Original tuple: ('Mathematics', 'Physics', 'Chemistry', 'Biology', 'English')

An error occurred:
Error message: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

This demonstrates that tuples are immutable and cannot be changed.
```

**Explanation**

- **Immutability**: An object is **immutable** if its state cannot be modified after it is created. Tuples are immutable. Lists are mutable.
- **The `TypeError`**: We wrap our modification attempt, `subjects_tuple[2] = "History"`, in a `try...except` block. Because tuples do not support item assignment, this line of code raises a `TypeError`.
- **Why Use Tuples?**: The immutability of tuples makes them useful for representing fixed collections of data. It provides a guarantee that the data cannot be accidentally changed, which can make code safer and more predictable. They are also often used as keys in dictionaries, which is not possible with lists.
