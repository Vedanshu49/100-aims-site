### Aim #38: Find difference between two sets.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to find the **difference** between two sets. The difference is a new set containing elements that are in the first set but *not* in the second set.

**Python Code**

```python
# All students who signed up for a trip
all_signed_up = {"Aarav", "Diya", "Vivaan", "Riya", "Kabir"}

# Students who have submitted their permission slip
permission_submitted = {"Diya", "Riya", "Aarav"}

print(f"All Signed Up: {all_signed_up}")
print(f"Permission Submitted: {permission_submitted}")

# Method 1: Using the - (difference) operator
missing_permission_op = all_signed_up - permission_submitted
print(f"\nStudents with missing permission (using '-'): {missing_permission_op}")

# Method 2: Using the .difference() method
missing_permission_method = all_signed_up.difference(permission_submitted)
print(f"Students with missing permission (using '.difference()'): {missing_permission_method}")
```

**Output**

```text
All Signed Up: {'Riya', 'Diya', 'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Kabir'}
Permission Submitted: {'Riya', 'Diya', 'Aarav'}

Students with missing permission (using '-'): {'Vivaan', 'Kabir'}
Students with missing permission (using '.difference()'): {'Vivaan', 'Kabir'}
```

**Explanation**

- **Set Difference**: The difference between `set A` and `set B` (`A - B`) is the set of all elements that are in `A` but are not in `B`. The order matters.
- **Difference Operator `-`**: The minus `-` operator is a simple way to perform this operation.
- **`.difference()` Method**: The `set1.difference(set2)` method achieves the same result. It returns a new set containing only the elements from `set1` that are not present in `set2`. Both approaches leave the original sets unchanged.
