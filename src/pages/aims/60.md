### Aim #60: Create a 1D NumPy array of 10 numbers.

**Description**

This program introduces **NumPy**, a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. We will demonstrate how to create a simple one-dimensional array of numbers.

**Python Code**

```python
# First, you need to have NumPy installed:
# pip install numpy

import numpy as np

# Create a 1D NumPy array from a Python list
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
my_array = np.array(my_list)

print(f"The 1D NumPy array is:\n{my_array}")
print(f"\nThe type of the object is: {type(my_array)}")
print(f"The shape of the array is: {my_array.shape}")
```

**Output**

```text
The 1D NumPy array is:
[0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

The type of the object is: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
The shape of the array is: (10,)
```

**Explanation**

- **Importing NumPy**: The standard convention is to `import numpy as np`. This makes the library's functions available under the `np` alias.
- **`np.array()`**: The `np.array()` function is the primary way to create a NumPy array. It can take a Python list (or other sequence types) as an argument.
- **`ndarray`**: The object created is a `numpy.ndarray`, which stands for "N-dimensional array". These arrays are more efficient for numerical operations than standard Python lists.
- **`.shape` Attribute**: The `.shape` attribute returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the array. For a 1D array of 10 elements, the shape is `(10,)`.
