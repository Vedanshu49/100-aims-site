### Aim #35: Perform union of two sets of students.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to find the **union** of two sets. The union is a new set containing all the unique elements from both original sets.

**Python Code**

```python
# Students in Class A
class_a = {"Aarav", "Diya", "Vivaan"}

# Students in Class B
class_b = {"Riya", "Kabir", "Diya"} # "Diya" is in both classes

print(f"Class A: {class_a}")
print(f"Class B: {class_b}")

# Method 1: Using the | (union) operator
all_students_op = class_a | class_b
print(f"\nUnion using operator '|': {all_students_op}")

# Method 2: Using the .union() method
all_students_method = class_a.union(class_b)
print(f"Union using '.union()' method: {all_students_method}")
```

**Output**

```text
Class A: {'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Diya'}
Class B: {'Kabir', 'Riya', 'Diya'}

Union using operator '|': {'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Riya', 'Kabir', 'Diya'}
Union using '.union()' method: {'Vivaan', 'Aarav', 'Riya', 'Kabir', 'Diya'}
```

**Explanation**

- **Set Union**: A union combines two sets to create a new set that includes every element from both original sets. Duplicate elements (like "Diya") are automatically handled and appear only once in the final set.
- **Union Operator `|`**: The pipe `|` operator is a clean and common way to perform a union. `set1 | set2` creates a new set with all elements from `set1` and `set2`.
- **`.union()` Method**: The `set1.union(set2)` method achieves the exact same result. It can sometimes be more readable if you are chaining multiple operations together. Both methods create a new set without modifying the original sets.
