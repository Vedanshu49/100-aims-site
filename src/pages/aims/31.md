### Aim #31: Clear all entries from the dictionary.

**Description**

This program demonstrates how to remove all key-value pairs from a dictionary, leaving it empty. We will use the `.clear()` method.

**Python Code**

```python
student_marks = {
    "Aarav Sharma": 95,
    "Diya Patel": 88,
    "Vivaan Singh": 92
}

print(f"Original dictionary: {student_marks}")

# The .clear() method removes all items from the dictionary in-place.
student_marks.clear()

print(f"\nDictionary after clearing: {student_marks}")
```

**Output**

```text
Original dictionary: {'Aarav Sharma': 95, 'Diya Patel': 88, 'Vivaan Singh': 92}

Dictionary after clearing: {}
```

**Explanation**

- **The `.clear()` Method**: `dictionary.clear()` is a method that modifies the dictionary directly, removing all of its items.
- **Result**: After calling `.clear()`, the dictionary still exists as an object, but it is now empty, represented by `{}`. This is similar to how `.clear()` works for lists.
