### Aim #3: Remove duplicate elements from a list.

**Description**

This program demonstrates an efficient way to remove duplicate items from a list. By converting the list to a set, which automatically discards duplicates, and then converting it back to a list, we can easily get a list with only unique elements.

**Python Code**

```python
# A list with duplicate student names
student_names = [
    "Aarav Sharma",
    "Diya Patel",
    "Vivaan Singh",
    "Aarav Sharma",
    "Ananya Reddy",
    "Diya Patel",
    "Kabir Shah"
]

print("Original list with duplicates:")
print(student_names)

# To remove duplicates, we can convert the list to a set, and then back to a list.
# Sets are collections that only store unique elements.
unique_names_list = list(set(student_names))

print("\nList after removing duplicates:")
print(unique_names_list)
```

**Output**

```text
Original list with duplicates:
['Aarav Sharma', 'Diya Patel', 'Vivaan Singh', 'Aarav Sharma', 'Ananya Reddy', 'Diya Patel', 'Kabir Shah']

List after removing duplicates:
['Vivaan Singh', 'Ananya Reddy', 'Aarav Sharma', 'Kabir Shah', 'Diya Patel']
```

**Explanation**

- **Initial List**: We start with a `student_names` list that contains several duplicate names, like "Aarav Sharma" and "Diya Patel".
- **The `set()` Conversion**: The core of this solution is `set(student_names)`. A **`set`** is an unordered collection of items where every element must be unique. When we convert our list into a set, Python automatically discards any duplicate entries.
- **The `list()` Conversion**: The result of the `set()` operation is a set, not a list. To get a list back, we use the `list()` constructor, which converts the set back into a list format. The new list, `unique_names_list`, now contains only the unique names.
- **A Note on Order**: It's important to note that converting to a **`set`** may change the original order of the elements, as sets do not maintain insertion order.
