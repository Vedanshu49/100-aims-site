## What is HTML?

**Description**

HTML stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It's the foundation of every website you see on the internet. HTML provides the structure and content of web pages using a system of tags and elements that tell browsers how to display information.

Think of HTML like the skeleton of a building—it provides the basic framework, while CSS adds the styling (like paint and furniture), and JavaScript adds interactivity (like automatic doors and lighting systems).

### Key Concepts

- **HyperText:** Text with links that connect to other documents
- **Markup:** A system of tags that describe the content
- **Language:** A standardized set of rules for writing code
- **Structure:** HTML organizes content into meaningful sections
- **Browser Interpretation:** Browsers read HTML and render it as web pages

### What HTML Does

HTML documents are plain text files with a `.html` extension. When you open an HTML file in a web browser, the browser reads the HTML code and displays the webpage accordingly.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>This is a basic HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`** - Tells the browser this is HTML5 (the current standard)
- **`<html>`** - The root element that wraps all content
- **`<head>`** - Contains metadata about the page (not displayed on page)
- **`<title>`** - Appears in the browser tab
- **`<body>`** - Contains all visible content
- **`<h1>`** - A heading (largest text)
- **`<p>`** - A paragraph of text

### Why Learn HTML?

1. **Foundation:** HTML is essential before learning CSS or JavaScript
2. **Accessibility:** Proper HTML makes websites accessible to everyone
3. **SEO:** Search engines understand HTML structure to index pages
4. **Career:** HTML skills are fundamental for web development
5. **Simplicity:** HTML is easy to learn yet powerful when combined with CSS and JavaScript

### Common Misconceptions

❌ **Myth:** "HTML is a programming language"
✅ **Truth:** HTML is a *markup* language—it structures content, but doesn't perform calculations or logic

❌ **Myth:** "You don't need to learn HTML if you use website builders"
✅ **Truth:** Understanding HTML helps you customize and optimize websites better

### Real-World Usage

- All websites use HTML as their foundation
- Email clients use HTML to format emails
- Mobile apps often use HTML components
- Content management systems (like WordPress) generate HTML
- Modern frameworks (React, Vue) ultimately generate HTML

### Practice Tips

1. **Open any website** and right-click → "View Page Source" to see real HTML
2. **Make small changes** to the HTML above and reload the page to see differences
3. **Validate HTML** using online validators to check for errors
4. **Inspect elements** using browser developer tools (F12 → Elements tab)
