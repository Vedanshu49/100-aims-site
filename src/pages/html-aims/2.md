## Your First Hello World

**Description**

Writing your first HTML document is exciting! In this aim, you'll create a simple HTML page that displays "Hello World" in your browser. This is a classic programming tradition—the first thing you create in any language.

### Key Concepts

- **Plain Text Editor:** You can write HTML in any text editor
- **File Extension:** HTML files must end with `.html`
- **Browser Display:** Browsers interpret HTML and display content
- **Saving and Opening:** How to save and view your HTML file

### Step-by-Step: Create Your First Page

**Step 1: Create the HTML File**

Create a new file named `hello.html` with this content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Step 2: Save the File**

- Save it as `hello.html` (not `.txt`)
- Save it in a folder you can find easily
- Windows: Right-click → Save As → Change extension to `.html`

**Step 3: Open in Browser**

- Find your `hello.html` file
- Double-click it OR
- Right-click → Open With → Select your browser
- You should see your page displayed!

### What's Happening Here?

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>          <!-- Tells browser: "This is HTML5" -->
<html>                   <!-- Root element (everything goes inside) -->
<head>                   <!-- Settings & metadata (not displayed) -->
  <title>My First Page</title>  <!-- Browser tab title -->
</head>
<body>                   <!-- Visible content goes here -->
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>  <!-- Large heading -->
  <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>  <!-- Paragraph text -->
</body>
</html>                  <!-- Close all tags -->
```

### Try These Modifications

**Change 1: Different Text**
```html
<h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
<p>I'm learning HTML!</p>
```

**Change 2: Add More Content**
```html
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
  <p>I'm going to be a web developer!</p>
</body>
```

**Change 3: Multiple Headings**
```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subtitle</h2>
<h3>Smaller Subtitle</h3>
```

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Saving as .txt instead of .html:**
```
File: hello.txt  ← Wrong!
```
✅ **Save with correct extension:**
```
File: hello.html  ← Correct!
```

❌ **Not using proper structure:**
```html
<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>World</p>
```
✅ **Always use complete structure:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Page</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>World</p>
</body>
</html>
```

❌ **Forgetting closing tags:**
```html
<p>This paragraph is not closed
<p>Another paragraph
```
✅ **Always close your tags:**
```html
<p>This paragraph is closed</p>
<p>So is this one</p>
```

### What You'll See

When you open `hello.html` in your browser, you'll see:

```
My First Page  ← Browser tab title

Hello World!   ← Your H1 heading (large and bold)

This is my first HTML page.  ← Your paragraph text
```

### Why Is This Important?

- **Foundation:** Every website starts with basic HTML like this
- **Confidence:** You'll see HTML actually working in a browser
- **Understanding:** You'll learn how browsers interpret HTML
- **Troubleshooting:** You'll practice finding and fixing errors

### Real-World Usage

- Web developers create thousands of HTML files
- "Hello World" programs are tradition in every programming language
- Testing is done by opening files in browsers
- Most websites started as simple pages just like this

### Practice Tips

1. **Experiment:** Change the text and see what happens
2. **Inspect:** Right-click page → Inspect to see your HTML code
3. **Try Different Browsers:** Open your file in Chrome, Firefox, Edge
4. **Keep Trying:** If something doesn't work, compare with the example
5. **Save Often:** Practice saving and refreshing your browser
